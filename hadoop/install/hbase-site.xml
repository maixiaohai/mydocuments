<configuration>
<property>
    <name>hbase.cluster.distributed</name>
    <value>true</value>
    <description>The mode the cluster will be in. Possible values are
      false for standalone mode and true for distributed mode.  If
      false, startup will run all HBase and ZooKeeper daemons together
      in the one JVM.

<property>
    <name>hbase.tmp.dir</name>
    <value>/Users/zhangxu/cloudera/ops/tmp/hbase-${user.name}</value>
    <description>Temporary directory on the local filesystem.
    Change this setting to point to a location more permanent
    than '/tmp' (The '/tmp' directory is often cleared on
    machine restart).

<property>
    <name>hbase.zookeeper.property.dataDir</name>
    <value>/Users/zhangxu/cloudera/ops/zk</value>
    <description>Property from ZooKeeper's config zoo.cfg.
    The directory where the snapshot is stored.
    </description>
  </property>
<property>
    <name>hbase.rootdir</name>
    <value>hdfs://localhost:8020/hbase</value>
    <description>The directory shared by region servers and into
    which HBase persists.  The URL should be 'fully-qualified'
    to include the filesystem scheme.  For example, to specify the
    HDFS directory '/hbase' where the HDFS instance's namenode is
    running at namenode.example.org on port 9000, set this value to:
    hdfs://namenode.example.org:9000/hbase.  By default HBase writes
    into /tmp.  Change this configuration else all data will be lost
    on machine restart.
